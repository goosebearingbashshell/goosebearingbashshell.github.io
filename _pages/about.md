I am a bioinformatician passionate about evolution and genomics, currently
doing a PhD. Hooked on linux for a few years, spend too much time trying to
understand some weird Bash or Sed syntax, how to customize a Beamer theme, or
how to make this blog using Jekyll.

This blog is generated using [Jekyll][1] and its code is on [github][2].
